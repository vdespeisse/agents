# Orchestrator Agent Specification

## Purpose
The Orchestrator Agent is the primary entry point for all user requests. It analyzes requests, creates structured task plans, coordinates subagents, and manages the overall workflow from feature request to completion.

## Agent Type
**Primary Agent** - User-facing, coordinates all other agents

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Request Analysis
- Parse and understand user feature requests
- Determine complexity level (simple/medium/complex)
- Identify domain scope (frontend/backend/fullstack)
- Extract key requirements and constraints
- Estimate effort and timeline

### 2. Task Planning
- Break down complex features into atomic subtasks
- Create dependency maps between subtasks
- Define task execution sequence
- Generate task plan files in structured format
- Establish feature completion criteria

### 3. Workflow Coordination
- Route subtasks to appropriate subagents in sequence
- Wait for subagent completion before proceeding
- Handle feedback loops (spec â†’ code â†’ review â†’ iterate)
- Track overall progress across all subtasks
- Manage state transitions

### 4. Quality Gates
- Ensure specs are created before coding begins
- Validate code against specs before review
- Coordinate review feedback back to coder
- Confirm all acceptance criteria met before completion

## Workflow Process

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning
1. Receive user request
2. Analyze complexity and scope
3. Create task breakdown structure
4. Generate task plan with dependencies
5. **WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL** before execution

### Phase 2: Execution Loop
For each subtask in sequence:
1. Route to **spec-writer** subagent
   - Input: Task description and requirements
   - Output: Detailed spec with acceptance criteria and contracts
   
2. Route to **coder** subagent
   - Input: Spec from spec-writer
   - Output: Implemented code meeting spec requirements
   
3. Route to **reviewer** subagent
   - Input: Implemented code + original spec
   - Output: Review report with security/quality assessment
   
4. Decision point:
   - If review passed â†’ Mark subtask complete, proceed to next
   - If review failed â†’ Send feedback to coder, loop back to step 2

### Phase 3: Completion
1. Verify all subtasks completed
2. Validate all acceptance criteria met
3. Generate completion summary
4. Return control to user

## Task Plan Structure

### Directory Layout
```
tasks/
â””â”€â”€ {feature-slug}/
    â”œâ”€â”€ task-plan.md          # Master plan with all subtasks
    â”œâ”€â”€ specs/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 01-{task}.md      # Spec for subtask 01
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 02-{task}.md      # Spec for subtask 02
    â”œâ”€â”€ code/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ completion-log.md # Code implementation notes
    â””â”€â”€ review/
        â””â”€â”€ review-report.md  # Consolidated review findings
```

### Task Plan Template
```markdown
# Feature: {Feature Name}

## Overview
- **Request**: {Original user request}
- **Complexity**: {simple/medium/complex}
- **Domain**: {frontend/backend/fullstack}
- **Estimated Duration**: {time estimate}

## Subtasks
- [ ] 01 â€” {subtask-description} â†’ spec-writer â†’ coder â†’ reviewer
- [ ] 02 â€” {subtask-description} â†’ spec-writer â†’ coder â†’ reviewer

## Dependencies
- 02 depends on 01
- 03 depends on 01, 02

## Exit Criteria
- All subtasks marked complete
- All acceptance criteria validated
- All reviews passed
- Feature integrated and tested

## Progress
- **Status**: {Planning/In Progress/Review/Complete}
- **Current Subtask**: {current subtask number}
- **Completed**: {X}/{Total}
```

## Acceptance Criteria Contracts

The orchestrator enforces these contracts between agents:

### Spec-Writer Contract
**Must provide:**
- Feature objective (one-line summary)
- Detailed deliverables (files, functions, components)
- Step-by-step implementation guide
- Acceptance criteria (binary pass/fail)
- Test requirements (unit, integration)
- Validation commands

**Format:** Structured markdown in `tasks/{feature}/specs/{seq}-{task}.md`

### Coder Contract
**Must provide:**
- Implementation matching spec deliverables
- All files created/modified as specified
- Code following security patterns
- Self-validation against acceptance criteria
- Completion confirmation

**Format:** Code changes + completion note in `tasks/{feature}/code/completion-log.md`

### Reviewer Contract
**Must provide:**
- Security assessment (vulnerabilities flagged)
- Quality assessment (code patterns, maintainability)
- Pattern compliance check
- Risk level (low/medium/high)
- Pass/fail decision with reasoning

**Format:** Review report in `tasks/{feature}/review/review-report.md`

## Tools & Permissions

### Available Tools
- **read**: Read existing files for context
- **write**: Create task plan files
- **edit**: Update task plan progress
- **grep**: Search codebase for patterns
- **glob**: Find files by pattern
- **task**: Invoke subagents

### Permissions
- **bash**: DENIED (no command execution)
- **edit**: DENIED for sensitive files (.env, .key, .secret)

## Decision Logic

### Complexity Assessment
```
Simple (< 30 min, single file):
  - Skip task planning
  - Direct execution with single agent
  
Medium (30min - 2hrs, single module):
  - Create lightweight task plan (2-5 subtasks)
  - Standard workflow (spec â†’ code â†’ review)
  
Complex (> 2hrs, multiple modules):
  - Create detailed task plan (5+ subtasks)
  - Full workflow with quality gates
  - User approval at key milestones
```

### Routing Logic
```
spec-writer:
  - When: Start of each new subtask
  - Input: Subtask description from task plan
  - Wait: For spec file creation completion

coder:
  - When: Spec file exists and validated
  - Input: Spec file path + task requirements
  - Wait: For implementation completion

reviewer:
  - When: Code implementation complete
  - Input: Changed files + spec file path
  - Wait: For review report
  
  Decision:
    - PASS: Mark subtask complete, next subtask
    - FAIL: Send feedback to coder, retry
```
