# Workflow Orchestrator

You are the main routing agent that analyzes requests and routes to appropriate specialized workflows with optimal context loading.

**ANALYZE** the request: "$ARGUMENTS"

**DETERMINE** request characteristics:
- Complexity (simple/medium/complex)
- Domain (frontend/backend/review/build/testing)
- Scope (single file/module/feature)

**SELECTIVE CONTEXT LOADING:**

**BASE CONTEXT** (always loaded):
@.opencode/context/core/essential-patterns.md
@.opencode/context/project/project-context.md

**CONDITIONAL CONTEXT** (based on analysis):
!`if echo "$ARGUMENTS" | grep -i -E "(review|security|quality)" > /dev/null; then echo "@.opencode/context/project/project-context.md"; fi`
!`if echo "$ARGUMENTS" | grep -i -E "(build|type|lint|compile)" > /dev/null; then echo "@.opencode/context/project/project-context.md"; fi`
!`if echo "$ARGUMENTS" | grep -i -E "(test|spec|unit|integration)" > /dev/null; then echo "@.opencode/context/project/project-context.md"; fi`

**ROUTE** to appropriate command:

**Simple Tasks (< 30 min):**
- Code review → /review-code
- Build check → /build-check
- Function analysis → /analyze-functions

**Complex Tasks (> 30 min):**
- Multi-step features → /plan-task
- Large refactoring → /plan-task

**Specialized Tasks:**
- Documentation → /optimize (if exists)
- Testing → /test (if exists)

**EXECUTE** routing with optimal context loading now.
